# 🛡️ Phishing Email Analysis –Cybersecurity Lab Project

This project is a detailed phishing email investigation conducted in a controlled cybersecurity lab environment. The sample was obtained from the open-source GitHub repository [PhishingPot](https://github.com/PhishingPot/phishing-pot) and analyzed to identify indicators of compromise, social engineering tactics, and malicious intent.

## 🎯 Objective

- Analyze a real-world phishing email sample
- Identify social engineering techniques
- Inspect header, domain, and link behavior
- Document threat indicators and recommended defenses
- Practice safe malware/email analysis in an isolated lab
